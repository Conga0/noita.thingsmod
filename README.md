The point of this project is to cooperatively extend Noita with content.
   
Everyone is free to add whatever the hell you want, feel free to make a pull request.  
It will likely be accepted as long as it is not broken and somewhat fits noita as a whole. We do not intend to make the game unplayable.
This is intended to be something the average Noita player can enjoy.
There is a thread for discussing it on the Noita Discord.
